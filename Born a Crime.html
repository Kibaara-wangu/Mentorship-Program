    <h1>Born a Crime</h1>
    <h3>Chapter 1 & 2 Summary</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <div class="words">
       <p> The book "Born A Crime" by Trevor Noah is a story about a mixed-race child <br>
        growing up during apartheid in South Africa. In two chapters, the author narrates <br>
         his experiences of being raised by a strict Christian mother in a racially segregated society.</p>


      <p> In Chapter 1, titled "Run," Trevor shares the challenges he and his mother faced due <br>
        to apartheid's racial segregation. The chapter highlights the tribal conflicts between the <br>
        Zulu and Xhosa tribes and depicts Trevor's struggle to come to terms with his mother's <br>
        unwavering faith. Despite his reluctance to attend church every Sunday, Trevor's mother was <br>
        determined to keep him safe, going so far as to throw him out of a moving car to protect him from a gang attack.</p>


        <p> In chapter 2, titled "Born A Crime," explores apartheid's oppressive laws. Trevor's existence, <br>
        as the child of a white father and a black mother, was considered a crime under these laws. The chapter <br>
        sheds light on the cruelty of apartheid and its impact on Trevor's life.


       <p>Drawing parallels with my hometown Nyeri, it is evident that the theme of resilience in the face of <br>
        misfortune is universal. In Nyeri, we grapple with issues of water scarcity, climate change, and land <br>
        disputes, which mirror the systemic injustices Trevor describes in his book. In addition, there are disparities <br>
        in church relations, with some churches catering to the rich while others serve the average population.</p>
