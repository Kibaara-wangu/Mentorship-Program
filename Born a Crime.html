    This text delves into the first two chapters of "Born A Crime," a book by Trevor Noah.
     These chapters provide a detailed account of the <br>life of a mixed-race child growing up 
     during apartheid in South Africa, raised by a strict Christian mother.
  </p>
   <p>
"Run," Trevor narrates the story of his mother's unwavering faith and the challenges they 
faced due to the racial segregation imposed by apartheid. <br> This chapter highlights the tribal 
conflicts between the Zulu and Xhosa tribes, and how these conflicts impacted the lives of people 
living in South Africa at the time. Despite being raised in a Christian household, Trevor is not 
fully convinced that they should go to church every Sunday. However, his mother is governed by her 
faith and wouldn't accept any of Trevor's excuses to skip church. This chapter also depicts Trevor's <br>
mother's determination to keep her son safe, even if it means throwing him out of a moving car to save him from a gang attack.
</p>

<p>
   "Born A Crime," starts by describing the oppressive laws of apartheid that made Trevor's very  
   existence a crime. As the child of a white father and a black mother, Trevor's existence was illegal . 
   at the time This chapter provides a detailed account of the impact of apartheid on the lives of black  
   people in South Africa, and how it affected Trevor's family. It highlights Trevor's mother's resilience  
   in the face of adversity, and her willingness to do whatever it takes to protect her son.

   <p>
    In relation to my county of Nyeri, we also face a range of challenges, including water scarcity, 
    climate change, and land issues, which mirror the systemic injustices described in Trevor's book.  
    Additionally, there are church relations between the rich and average people that exist in my 
    county. These issues may differ from those faced by  the characters in the book, but the theme of resilience in the face of misfortune is universal.
